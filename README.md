**MIAFEx** refines the Transformer [CLS] token with learnable weights to produce robust features for medical image classification, particularly effective on small/medium datasets. It ships a full pipeline: supervised training, feature extraction, wrapper-based feature selection (PSO/DE/GA), and classical classifiers (LR/SVM/RF/XGB).
